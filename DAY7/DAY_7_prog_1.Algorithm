/*** 1.Write a program to convert a data stream from Little Endian to Big Endian (you can take any 8 bit value or use 0b110101110)?*****/

ALGORITHM:-

  1: assign hexadecimal value to variable 
  2: do swapping of LSB and MSB bit
  3: first set lsb bit by anding operation and store in one variable then similarly set msb bit and store in another variable and 
     do right shift and left shift operation for swapping then add both shifting result and store in one variable we get swapped value.
