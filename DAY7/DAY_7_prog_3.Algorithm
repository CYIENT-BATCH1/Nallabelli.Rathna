/********3.program to clear(0) bits CIS, CM2, CM1, CM0 in register “CMCON” if bits CHS3, CHS2, CHS1, CHS0 bits are set to 0x07 in register “ADCON0”******/

ALGORITHM:-

1: assing variable for two 8 bit register num1 num2  
2: enter value in one register and do anding operation with 28 binary value because in that cis cm2 cm1 cmo set to 00011100(0x07) 
   if this result value equal to 28 then second register 4 bit chs3 chs2 chs1 chs0 make clear by anding operation with 0xF0 
3: if num1 value is not equal then print not equal.
