ALGORITHM:

1.Read the temperature and RPM values which they given
2.convert them into binary form.
3.store temperature and RPM values in an array of size 5.
4.In this the temperature value will be stored in an array of 3rd element.
5.In RPM value the 0th bit will be stored in an array of of 2nd element.
6.RPM values of 1 to 8 bits will be stored in an array of of 1st element.
7.From 9 to 12 bits it stores in array of 0th element.
