/*****2.Write a program in C to sort an array using Pointer. The sample output must be as below.*********/

ALGORITHM:-

1.Take an array variable.
2.sort the numbers using pointer with for loop and
3.If *(ptr+j) greater than *(ptr+i) then again start looping for small number.   
4.If *(ptr+j) less than *(ptr+i) then check the conditions which is about swapping logic using third variable.
5.After checking the statements of if condition then print the sorted elements in ascending order.
